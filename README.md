#World Nuclear-Explosions from 1945 to 1998


A visualization of the nuclear-explosions in the world from 1945 to 1998 using [D3.js](https://d3js.org/). The map window can be zoomed and the timeBar can be brushed to select the explosions under a certain condition.

- The data are from “[Nuclear Explosions, 1945–1998](http://www.iaea.org/inis/collection/NCLCollectionStore/_Public/31/060/31060372.pdf),” published by the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI) and Sweden's Defence Research Establishment in July, 2000.

- The structured data comes from [data-is-plural](https://github.com/data-is-plural/nuclear-explosions).

- The timeLine bar down below can be used as a time filter to choose the explosions in that period of time.

- The map window can be zoomed to check the details.

- The time bar changes according to the map window to show the statistic of explosions only on the screen.

- Yield of each nuclear-explosions can be seen as the perimeter of the black circle, some explosions take places in the same position so it can be very dark in some places.

- Used the map template from [TechSlides](http://techslides.com/d3-map-starter-kit/) to finish this visualization.
